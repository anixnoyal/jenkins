We are excited to introduce our new Jenkins controller setup, designed to enhance your experience with improved performance and connectivity. Key features of this new architecture include:

New Architecture with Fewer Network Hops: The updated setup minimizes network hops, resulting in faster and more efficient communication between Jenkins components.
Jenkins Nodes Connections Using WebSocket: By utilizing WebSocket connections for Jenkins nodes, we ensure more stable and responsive interactions
, improving overall system reliability.
3. No More Firewall Requests: The new setup eliminates the need for firewall requests, simplifying the configuration process and enhancing security.
4. New Node Creation Requirement: All users will need to create new nodes on this

Jenkins controller, ensuring the selection of WebSocket for connections to leverage the full benefits of the new architecture.
